Instruction:

You will be given an oracle caption that describes an image, which may be composed of multiple sub-figures or panels. You will then receive a second caption written for the same image.

Your Task:

Compare the second caption with the oracle caption and evaluate it using the criteria outlined below.

Evaluation Criteria:

Assess how accurately the second caption reflects the key elements and context described in the oracle caption. The second caption should correctly describe each sub-figure and panel, focusing on the same subjects, objects, information, and context as the oracle caption, without introducing unrelated or extraneous details.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Review the Oracle Caption:
Carefully read the oracle caption, identifying each panel mentioned.

2. Check the Second Caption:
For each panel described in the oracle caption, assess how well it is represented in the second caption.

3. Assign the Score:
For each of the N panels discussed in the oracle caption, assign a score from 0 to 5 based on how accurately it is described in the second caption. Return the scores as a list.
