You will be given a oracle caption that describes an image. You will then be given a second caption written for the same image.

Your task is to rate the second caption's consistency with the oracle caption.

Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - The alignment between the second caption and the oracle caption in describing the same image. A consistent caption should accurately reflect the key elements and details described in the oracle caption without introducing conflicting or unrelated information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Review the Oracle Caption: Carefully read the oracle caption and understand the details and key elements it describes.
2. Review the Second Caption: Compare the second caption to the oracle caption, checking for consistency in how both captions describe the same image. Look for any discrepancies or conflicting details between the two captions.
3. Assign a Score for Consistency: Based on the Evaluation Criteria, rate how well the second caption aligns with the oracle caption in describing the same image.
